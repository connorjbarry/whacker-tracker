For Software Design Review on Wednesday, February 15 2023 -
The important files lie in the `analytics` directory, for the beginning of data analysis software.

The companion apps most important files lie in the `companion-app` directory -> `src` -> `components` & `pages` directories.

If there is a need to test the progress on the companion app (testing the analytical software will be harder, but I can provide a demo for progress) clone the repository, navigate to the `companion-app` directory, and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev`. This will start the app on `localhost:3000`.
